S1: A foreign key declaration
    can always be replaced by
    an equivalent check
    assertion in SQL.
S2: Given the table R(a,b,c)
    where a and b together
    form the primary key, the
      following is a valid
      table definition.
        CREATE TABLE S (
            a INTEGER,
            d INTEGER,
            e INTEGER,
            PRIMARY KEY (d),
            FOREIGN KEY (a)
            references R)
